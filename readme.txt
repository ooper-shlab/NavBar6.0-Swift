# NavBar

Translated by OOPer in cooperation with shlab.jp, on 2015/3/16.

The translated project contains Objective-C files, to use with unavalable-in-Swift methods.
For somebody who are searching a full-Swift solution, this is not yours.

As this is a line-by-line translation from the original sample code, "redistribute the Apple Software in its entirety and without modifications" would apply. See license terms in each file.
Some faults caused by my translation may exist. Not all features tested.
You should not contact to Apple or SHLab(jp) about any faults caused by my translation.
